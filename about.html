  <p style="text-align: center;">My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/codsalah/">Salah Algamasy</a>, I graduated from Zagazig
    University, Faculty of Science, with a major in Mathematics and Computer Science.
    I am interested in software engineering, with a specific focus on security engineering, particularly web application
    security.
    I also enjoy studying mathematics and its relationship to computer science, especially analytical subjects.
    I am constantly learning about optimization and enjoy building simple, high-quality programs aimed at making life
    easier for people or addressing societal issues, contributing to a better life for them.
    I love blogging about what I learn or engaging in discussions and thinking through topics with others, as it helps
    me understand things more deeply.

      <h4>Description</h4>
    </span>In epilepsy, approximately 67% of individuals respond well to medication, 7-8% to neurosurgery, while 25%
    face recurrent seizures with no effective treatment. To enhance care for this group, a user-friendly device (using a
    pulse sensor, ESP32, and an accelerometer) is proposed for automated seizure detection, aiming to reduce the burden
    of monitoring and accidents related to epilepsy.</p>
  <br>
  <p><span>
      <h4>Story of the project</h4>
    </span> </span>
    This is my First-Term Graduation Project. Before it, I had no knowledge about IoT or mobile development. I began
    working on it before the deadline, completing it within 12 days despite routine problems at the college. This proved
    to be a significant disaster for me, prompting me to seek advice from everyone I knew. After some time, I discovered
    that I had a good foundation to complete this project within the deadline.
    During this period, I learned about the components I would use, such as the ESP32, MPU6050, and MAX30102. I delved
    into how to install them together and write code for their functionality. I gained insights into dual-core usage for
    reading data from the device and sending it to my cloud server. I also learned how to implement a fall detection
    algorithm and enhance it with heart rate monitoring to detect seizures. This process consumed a considerable amount
    of time, especially during exam periods, making me realize that I hadn't created the mobile application yet.
    The next day, I began learning how to create it using Flutter. I dedicated an entire day to work and learning,
    eventually creating a basic application that fetched data from my server, displayed it, and sent notifications to my
    phone when seizures occurred using Firebase Messaging and local notifications. This was sufficient for me. After
    that, I wrote a simple Python server to interact with different APIs, such as Twilio for sending SMS, Mailgun for
    sending emails, and Firebase Cloud Messaging for sending notifications to the phone if anything happened.
    Now, it was time for deployment. I deployed it using Microsoft Azure, Nginx, and Gunicorn, and everything worked
    fine before the deadline, earning me an excellent grade.</p>

      <h4>Story of the project</h4>
    </span> </span>
    The name Thoth is the name of the Egyptian god of knowledge. This is a side project I created during my second year
    at university. I developed it in response to the continuous requests from my colleagues for study resources and
    notes. The idea was to have a chatbot that could provide immediate answers to such requests. I collected lecture
    notes and data from my colleagues and built the bot. Within three days, it gained popularity, and other departments
    from my college requested to add materials for them. It was eventually used by more than 150 active users.

    </span> Desktop application to manage supplier operations for importers. </p>

      <h4>Story of the project</h4>
    </span> </span>
    I built this application when I found that my friend, who works as an importer of laptops and computer kits, was
    facing challenges when a new shipment arrived. He struggled with managing orders, including tracking quantities,
    origins, remaining payments to suppliers, warehouse inventory, and more. I developed this project to assist him in
    efficiently tracking and organizing his orders.

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">This publication is for my second-term graduation research.<span
    style="color: rgb(39, 192, 46);"> Till now, my professor hasn't confirmed its public release. However, feel free to
    request access to it.</span><br>This article presents an application of the (Gâ€²/G)- expansion method to the
  Mikhailov-Novikov-Wang equation, a non-evolutionary partial differential equation that has garnered extensive research
  attention due to its fundamental significance in various branches of physics and mathematics. The (Gâ€²/G)-expansion
  method is a powerful mathematical tool for finding exact solutions for nonlinear partial differential equations. In
  this article, we describe the main steps of the (Gâ€²/G)- expansion method and apply it to the Mikhailov-Novikov- Wang
  equation. We obtain new exact solutions for this complex system, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
  (Gâ€²/G)-expansion method in solving challenging problems in physics and mathematics. This article highlights the
  importance of nonlinear partial differential equations in modeling complex physical phenomena and underscores the
  value of mathematical tools such as the (Gâ€²/G)-expansion method in advancing our understanding of these systems.</p>
