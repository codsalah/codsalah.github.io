# Welcome to My Data Engineering Journey

Hello and welcome to my blog! I'm **Salah Algamasy**, a passionate Data Engineer and Computer Engineering student with a deep fascination for transforming raw data into meaningful insights.

## Academic Background

I am currently pursuing a **Bachelor's in Computer Engineering** (2020-2025), where I have developed a rigorous foundation in:

- **Data Structures & Algorithms**: Optimizing computational efficiency in data processing.
- **Distributed Computing**: Engineering systems for large-scale data management.
- **Database Systems**: Designing high-performance storage and retrieval architectures.
- **Infrastructure & Systems**: Understanding the low-level environments that power data pipelines.

## Professional Experience

My technical journey has been defined by focused professional development and hands-on experience in complex data environments:

### Data Engineer Intern | DataLoops
*May 2025 - Present*

Contributing to the architecture of scalable data pipelines and implementing advanced data management practices across diverse technical environments.

### Big Data Specialization | Orange Digital Center
*August 2024 - September 2024*

Advanced training in enterprise-level big data technologies, focusing on containerization and distributed processing:
- **Environment Management**: Docker/Containerization
- **Distributed Computing**: Hadoop & Apache Spark
- **Data Warehousing**: Apache Hive
- **Automation**: Apache NiFi
- **Database Systems**: PostgreSQL & MongoDB

### Professional Development | NTI & DEPI
*February 2024 - September 2024*

Intensive technical specialization in ETL architecture and warehouse implementation:
- **Pipeline Architecture**: ETL processes using SSIS
- **Warehouse Design**: Architecture and implementation strategies
- **Engineering Tools**: Python, MS SQL, and Apache Spark

## Featured Engineering Projects

I focus on developing end-to-end solutions that address complex data scalability challenges:

### Real-Time Analytics Pipeline
Architected a streaming data pipeline using **Kafka**, **Spark Streaming**, and **Cassandra**. Implemented orchestration through **Apache Airflow** and managed transformations with **dbt** for real-time analytical consistency.

### Distributed Data Warehouse
Designed a multi-format warehousing solution supporting OLTP and OLAP workloads. Optimized for **Parquet and Avro** formats using **Spark**, **Hive**, and **Trino**.

### ML Lifecycle Automation
Developed a comprehensive data lifecycle project integrating automated ETL, **MLflow** for experiment tracking, and **FastAPI** for production deployment.

## Technical Proficiency

**Distributed Processing**: Apache Spark, Hadoop, Hive, Kafka  
**Storage Architecture**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, Cassandra  
**Pipeline Orchestration**: Apache Airflow, Apache NiFi, SSIS, dbt  
**Engineering Environment**: Python, SQL, Bash, Docker, Git

## Core Objectives

My work is centered on three primary pillars of Data Engineering:

1. **Strategic Architecture**: Building resilient pipelines capable of industrial scale.
2. **Knowledge Transmission**: Contributing technical insights to the engineering community.
3. **Technological Advancment**: Implementing state-of-the-art solutions in distributed computing.

## Professional Connection

I am always keen to engage with fellow engineers and professionals in the data space. Whether discussing distributed system design or pipeline optimization, I look forward to contributing to the broader technical dialogue.
