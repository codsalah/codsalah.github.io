# Welcome to My Data Engineering Journey

Hello and welcome to my blog! I'm **Salah Algamasy**, a passionate Data Engineer and Computer Engineering student with a deep fascination for transforming raw data into meaningful insights.

## üéì My Background

I'm currently pursuing my **Bachelor's in Computer Engineering** at the University of Kafrelsheikh (2020-2025), where I've built a strong foundation in:

- **Data Structures & Algorithms** - The backbone of efficient data processing
- **Distributed Systems** - Essential for handling big data at scale
- **Databases & Machine Learning** - Core technologies for modern data solutions
- **Operating Systems & Networks** - Understanding the infrastructure that powers data pipelines

## üíº Professional Experience

My journey in data engineering has been shaped by hands-on experience across multiple organizations:

### üîÑ Current Role: Data Engineer Intern at DataLoops
*May 2025 - Present*

I'm currently working remotely with DataLoops, a startup where I'm diving deep into:
- Data pipeline architecture and design
- Advanced data analysis techniques
- Modern data management practices

### üçä Big Data Training at Orange Digital Center Egypt
*August 2024 - September 2024*

This intensive program introduced me to enterprise-level big data technologies:
- **Docker** for creating reproducible data environments
- **Hadoop** for distributed large-scale data management
- **Apache Spark** for lightning-fast in-memory processing
- **Apache Hive** for efficient data warehousing
- **Apache NiFi** for automated data flow orchestration
- **PostgreSQL & MongoDB** for diverse data storage needs

### üèõÔ∏è Government Training Programs
*February 2024 - September 2024*

Through programs with **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative** and **National Telecommunication Institute (NTI)**, I gained expertise in:
- **ETL processes** using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)
- **Data warehousing** architecture and implementation
- **Python & MS SQL** for data manipulation and analysis
- **Apache Spark** through hands-on laboratory work

## üöÄ What I Build

I'm passionate about creating end-to-end data solutions. Here are some highlights from my project portfolio:

### Real-Time Retail Analytics Pipeline
Built a complete streaming data pipeline processing retail transactions in real-time using **Kafka**, **Spark Streaming**, and **Cassandra**, with orchestration via **Apache Airflow** and transformations using **dbt**.

### Multi-Format Data Warehouse
Designed a versatile data warehouse supporting both OLAP and OLTP workloads, handling **CSV, Parquet, and Avro** formats using **Spark**, **Hive**, and **Trino**.

### Movie Recommender System
Created a full data lifecycle project featuring automated ETL, machine learning with **Sentence Transformers**, experiment tracking with **MLflow**, and deployment using **FastAPI**.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Technology Stack

I work with a diverse range of technologies across the data engineering spectrum:

**Big Data Processing:** Apache Spark, Hadoop, Hive, Kafka  
**Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, SQLite, Cassandra  
**ETL/Pipeline Tools:** Apache Airflow, Apache NiFi, SSIS, dbt  
**Programming:** Python, SQL, Bash  
**Cloud & DevOps:** Docker, Git  
**Visualization:** Power BI, Streamlit  
**ML/Analytics:** MLflow, Pandas, Sentence Transformers  

## üìù What You'll Find Here

This blog is my space to share:

- **Technical tutorials** on data engineering tools and techniques
- **Project deep-dives** showcasing real-world data solutions
- **Industry insights** from my experience in the data field
- **Learning resources** for aspiring data engineers
- **Best practices** for building scalable data architectures

## üéØ My Mission

I believe that data is the new oil, but only when properly refined and processed. My mission is to:

1. **Build robust data pipelines** that can handle any scale
2. **Share knowledge** with the data engineering community
3. **Explore cutting-edge technologies** in big data and analytics
4. **Bridge the gap** between raw data and actionable insights

## ü§ù Let's Connect

I'm always excited to connect with fellow data enthusiasts, engineers, and anyone passionate about the power of data. Whether you're just starting your data journey or you're a seasoned professional, I'd love to hear from you!
