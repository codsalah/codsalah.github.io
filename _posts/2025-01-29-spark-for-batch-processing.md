# Spark for Batch Processing

Apache Spark is a powerful distributed computing framework that excels at processing large datasets in batch mode.

## What is Batch Processing?

Batch processing involves processing large volumes of data in chunks or "batches" at scheduled intervals.

## Why Spark for Batch Processing?

- **Speed**: In-memory computing makes Spark much faster than traditional MapReduce
- **Ease of Use**: Simple APIs in Python, Scala, Java, and R
- **Unified Platform**: Handles batch, streaming, ML, and graph processing
